# GA Vs. 8 Queens
>   This web application is a work in progress. I am building it [live on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/robbybergers), and will be releasing a more condensed, entertaining and educational version of the whole development process through a YouTube video series.

# Mission Statement
>   This is the ultimate goal of the project. Written as though the project is already completed, so you can have a clear understanding of what I am working towards and why.

This is a web application that hosts a Genetic Algorithm built in Python, that can be interfaced with through a MERN web application. Any non-technical person that is interested in the power of AI is able to get a visual and kinesthetic understanding of the inner workings of AI algorithms through an interactive React application without getting bogged down with the semantic noise of computer science jargon and theory. 

This topic can be incredibly complex, but in the end it makes sense and anybody with an interest is able to get a solid conceptual understanding without any programming knowledge or experience. However, for those aspiring computer scientists and software engineers with little real world experience, there is a more technical and in-the-weeds explanation of how the algorithms work with some great sources cited and every esoteric term linked to a more in-depth explanation. 

This project is open source and local-machine friendly, so that any tinkerer is free to fork the repository on GitHub, mess with the logic of the algorithms then watch how it performs, without worrying about any of the leg work of storing data, running a server or creating a front-end interface.

# Documentation
>   Since this project is still being created, the documentation is minimal and subject to change.

## Getting Started

This is a web application utilizes the MERN stack ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/)). Due to the amazing [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), many of the technologies used will be installed automatically, however there are a few prerequisites you need installed on your machine before you can run this project.

1.  **[Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home)**
    >   This project is hosted on GitHub. To create your own version, you will need a GitHub account.

1.  **Fork the repository**
    >   (This step requires you to be on [The Github repository page](https://github.com/RobbyB97/ga-vs-8queens))

    Once you are on the repository's GitHub page and you are logged into your GitHub account, you need to _fork_ the repository. Click the fork button on the top right of the page to create your own personal copy of the codebase.
